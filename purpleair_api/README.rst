PurpleAir API Package
=====================

This directory contains the main source code for the PurpleAir API Python wrapper.

Package Structure
-----------------

The package is organized into several modules:

Core Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **PurpleAirAPI.py** - Main entry point that combines Read, Write, and Local APIs
* **PurpleAirReadAPI.py** - Read-only API operations for querying sensor data
* **PurpleAirWriteAPI.py** - Write API operations for managing sensors and members
* **PurpleAirLocalAPI.py** - Direct communication with local PurpleAir sensors

Supporting Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **PurpleAirAPIConstants.py** - Constants and configuration values used throughout the API
* **PurpleAirAPIError.py** - Custom exception classes for error handling
* **PurpleAirAPIHelpers.py** - Utility functions used by the API modules

Module Overview
---------------

PurpleAirAPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main entry point that automatically loads the appropriate submodules (Read, Write, Local)
based on the API keys and configuration provided during initialization.

PurpleAirReadAPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provides read-only access to the PurpleAir API including:

* Requesting sensor data by sensor index
* Requesting data from multiple sensors
* Retrieving historical sensor data
* Querying sensor metadata and fields

PurpleAirWriteAPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provides write access to the PurpleAir API including:

* Creating and managing members
* Updating sensor configurations
* Managing sensor ownership

PurpleAirLocalAPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provides direct access to PurpleAir sensors on the local network without requiring API keys:

* Reading real-time data from local sensors
* Faster response times for local queries
* No rate limiting from the cloud API

Usage
-----

For detailed usage examples, see the main `README <../README.rst>`_ in the repository root.
