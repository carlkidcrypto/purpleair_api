## Purpose

This package is designed to be used for making tools around the PurpleAir API.

For example, PAA data loggers - <https://github.com/carlkidcrypto/purpleair_data_logger>

## Installation

You can install the PurpleAir API via pip.

```bash
python3 -m pip install purple_air_api
```

You can install PurpleAir API by cloning down this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carlkidcrypto/purple_air_api.git
cd purple_air_api
python3 setup.py install
```

## PurpleAirAPI Usage Example

First we need to import the PurpleAir API (PAA)

```python
from purpleair_api.PurpleAirAPI import PurpleAirAPI
```

Next we need to make an instance of PAA.

```python
my_paa = PurpleAirAPI(your_api_read_key, your_api_write_key, your_ipv4_address)
```

Now you can use that PAA instance to do things like...

```python
retval = my_paa.request_sensor_data(1234)
```

> Note: PurpleAirAPI is the main entry point. It will load read, write, and local submodules
based on the parameters that are passed in upon construction. If you wish to only use a
small piece of PurpleAirAPI then see the examples below.

## PurpleAirReadAPI Usage Example

First we need to import the PurpleAirReadAPI.

```python.
from purpleair_api.PurpleAirReadAPI import PurpleAirReadAPI
```

Now we need to make an instance if it.

```python
my_paa = PurpleAirReadAPI(api_read_key)
```

Now we can use that instance to do things like...
```python
retval = my_paa.request_multiple_sensors_data("name")
```

## PurpleAirWriteAPI Usage Example

First we need to import the PurpleAirWriteAPI.

```python.
from purpleair_api.PurpleAirWriteAPI import PurpleAirWriteAPI
```

Now we need to make an instance if it.

```python
my_paa = PurpleAirWriteAPI(api_write_key)
```

Now we can use that instance to do things like...
```python
retval = my_paa.post_create_member(1234)
```

## PurpleAirLocalAPI Usage Example

First we need to import the PurpleAirLocalAPI.

```python.
from purpleair_api.PurpleAirLocalAPI import PurpleAirLocalAPI
```

Now we need to make an instance if it.

```python
my_paa = PurpleAirLocalAPI(["ipv4_address"])
```

Now we can use that instance to do things like...
```python
retval = my_paa.request_local_sensor_data()
```
