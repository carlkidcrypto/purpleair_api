Documentation Directory
=======================

This directory contains the generated HTML documentation for the PurpleAir API project.

Directory Structure
-------------------

::

   docs/
   ├── html/              # Current release documentation (HTML format)
   ├── doctrees/          # Sphinx build cache (not committed to git)
   ├── .nojekyll          # Disables Jekyll processing for GitHub Pages
   └── index.html         # Redirect to html/modules.html

Generated Documentation
-----------------------

The ``html/`` directory contains the complete API documentation generated by Sphinx.
These files are committed to the repository for deployment to GitHub Pages.

This includes:

* API reference for all modules
* Usage examples
* Module indices and search functionality

Viewing Documentation
---------------------

Local Viewing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open ``html/index.html`` in your web browser:

.. code-block:: bash

   # On macOS
   open html/index.html
   
   # On Linux
   xdg-open html/index.html
   
   # On Windows
   start html/index.html

GitHub Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The documentation is available on GitHub Pages at:
https://carlkidcrypto.github.io/purpleair_api/

Rebuilding Documentation
------------------------

The documentation is built from the source files in the ``sphinx_docs_build/`` directory.
To rebuild the documentation:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ../sphinx_docs_build
   make clean
   make html

For more information about building documentation, see the 
`sphinx_docs_build README <../sphinx_docs_build/README.rst>`_.

Versioned Documentation
-----------------------

Future versions of the documentation can be maintained alongside the current version:

* ``html/`` - Current release
* ``html_v1.3.1/`` - Version 1.3.1 release

This allows users to reference documentation for specific versions of the package.

Files in This Directory
-----------------------

.nojekyll
~~~~~~~~~

This file tells GitHub Pages not to process the documentation with Jekyll.
This is important because Jekyll ignores directories starting with underscores,
which would break Sphinx's ``_static/`` and ``_sources/`` directories.

index.html
~~~~~~~~~~

A simple redirect file that points to the main documentation page at ``html/modules.html``.

html/
~~~~~

Contains the generated HTML documentation. These files **are committed to git** and
deployed to GitHub Pages. When documentation is updated, rebuild using ``make html``
in the ``sphinx_docs_build/`` directory and commit the changes.

doctrees/
~~~~~~~~~

Contains Sphinx's internal cache files. This directory is not committed to git
(excluded via ``.gitignore``) as these are build artifacts that should be 
regenerated when needed.
